                    <h1>Hamidur Rahman</h1>
<h4>2 February 1953 -  October 1971</h4>



                      
                       <p>Hamidur Rahman was born on 2 February 1953 in Khardo Khalishpur village under Moheshpur police station of the Jhenaidah district, and was the eldest son of his family. During the Partition of India in 1947, his paternal properties fell in India. They crossed over the border and settled in the bordering area of Khorda Khalishpur of Jhenaidah district.

                        He joined East Bengal Regiment on 2 February 1971 and participated in the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War. During the war he made a significant contribution in capturing the Dhalai Border Outpost at Srimangal. Though the independence fighters came very close to the Border Outpost, it became very difficult to capture owing to the enemy machine gun which was continuously firing from the south-western corner of the Dhalai Border Outpost.[citation needed] On 28 October 1971, a battle was taking place between 1st East Bengal Regiment and 30 A Frontier Force Regiment in Dhalai of Sylhet. 125 members of the East Bengal Regiment decided to use grenades on the machine gun posts of the Pakistani army. Rahman took the responsibility of throwing grenades, and crawled through the hilly canals. He managed to throw two grenades before he was shot.[1] Hamidur Rahman jumped into the enemy machine gun post and engaged in hand to hand fighting with the two crews who were guarding the gun, and at one point neutralized the gun.[1] Realizing the fact that the machine gun outpost was damaged, the EBR's approach towards the enemy captured their first line within a short period of time. After the capture of the Dhalai Border Outpost, members of the EBR found the dead body of Rahman.[1] Sepoy Hamidur Rahman's efforts helped the East Bengal Regiment take the outpost. He was buried in Tripura in India. On 27 October 2007, advisers of the Bangladeshi caretaker government decided to bring back his remains to Bangladesh and bury him besides Bir Shrestho Matiur Rahman. It is said[by whom?] that the last place he stood alive was about 20 feet away from the Pakistani bunker, either in a canal or where the memorial is (near the bunker).[2] 10 December 2007 the remains of Hamidur Rahman were bought back to Bangladesh and on 11 December 2007 he was buried again at Buddhijibi Koborsthan (Cemetery), Dhaka.[3]
                        
                        
                        For the courage, valour, dedication to the cause of his motherland and supreme sacrifice, he was conferred Bir Sreshtho by the nation of Bangladesh.</p>

<h4> October 29, 1941 -   August 20, 1971</h4>



                   
                    <p>On 20 August, 1971 he attempted to hijack a T-33 trainer from Karachi, Pakistan to India in order to defect from the Pakistan Air Force and join the Liberation movement of Bangladesh. However, Flt Lt Matiur Rahman could not take the plane out of Pakistani territory. The plane crashed in Thatta, 40 kilometres from the Indian border, because of the struggle to regain control of the plane by Pilot Officer Rashid Minhas. His body, which was found near the crash site, was buried at the military graveyard at Masroor Air Base.[2][not in citation given] Matiur's widow, Milly, and his two infant daughters were imprisoned for a month by Pakistan Air Force, and were released on September 29, 1971


                        After over 30 years of negotiations, Motiur's body was finally returned to Bangladesh on 24 June, 2006 for a ceremonial and highly symbolic reburial in 2006. He was buried at the Martyred Intellectuals Graveyard, in Mirpur, Dhaka, with full military honours.[1] His original burial in a nondescript grave in Pakistan had been a sore point between Bangladesh and Pakistan for decades.</p>

            Death
            
            
            East Bengal Regiment wanted to restrict the Pakistan Army from using the Rangamati-Mahalchari waterway. Thus, they camped at both of the Chingri Lakes at Burighat. Munshi Abdur Rouf was serving as a soldier in this company.
            
            
            In order to prevent the Pakistan Army from utilizing the Rangamati-Mahalchari waterway, 8th East Bengal Regiment constructed a camp at both sides
            
            On 18 April 1971, Pakistan Army attacked at the defense position of Mukti Bahini with 7 speed boats and 2 launches. Their mission was to drive the Mukti Bahini away from the waterway of Rangamati and Mohalchari. Pakistani forces managed to disorient Mukti Bahini by coming closer to them and firing heavily. In the meantime Pakistanis surrounded the freedom fighters and managed to isolate nearly 100 of them. Rouf realized the threat to the entire company. So, he crawled forward to his trench and continuously fired towards the enemies with his automatic machine gun. As a result, Pakistanis dragged their launches back to a safer place and resumed their firing from there. Suddenly a mortar directly hit Rouf and he died immediately. Munshi Abdur Rouf's valiant effort helped his company to survive as his act saved nearly 150 soldiers of the Mukti Bahini on that day.</p>
